# Wildlife-Occlusion-Detection-Recognition-System-Python-YOLOv8-YOLOv11-RF-DETR-Roboflow
A deep-learning–based wildlife detection and recognition system designed to accurately identify animals under heavy occlusion in complex forest environments.
The system leverages YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and RF-DETR models and is trained on a custom annotated dataset to handle real-world challenges such as vegetation obstruction, overlapping animals, and low visibility.

🚀 Key Highlights

Developed an end-to-end wildlife detection pipeline using Python and state-of-the-art object detection models

Built a custom dataset with 12 wildlife classes and 12,000 manually annotated frames

Trained and evaluated YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and RF-DETR

Achieved 93% detection accuracy with YOLOv11, making it suitable for real-time animal localization

Robust performance under:

Heavy occlusion

Dense vegetation

Overlapping animals

Low-visibility forest conditions

🧠 Models Used

YOLOv8 – Fast baseline object detection

YOLOv11 – High-accuracy real-time detection (best performing model)

RF-DETR – Transformer-based detector for complex scenes
